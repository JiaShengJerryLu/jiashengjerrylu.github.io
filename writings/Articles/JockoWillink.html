			<p>Jocko Willink is a retired American Navy SEAL, the author of books such as Discipline Equals Freedom, The Dichotomy of Leadership, and also the host of Jocko Podcast, with over 146 episodes and counting, where he discusses a variety of topics on leadership, war, character, and life. Actually, you may have heard of him on the internet as the hardcore dude who wakes up at 4:30AM every day (sometimes earlier!), and telling everyone to “get after it”. </p>
			<p>I was first introduced to this man when my great friend Nima recommended the Jocko Podcast to me this summer, I started listening to it with curiosity. The very first episode was extremely powerful and pulled me right into the series. After about 2 months of listening to the Jocko Podcast, as well as watching his other videos on youtube, I have heard some of the most valuable and inspiring lessons, and they have, in many little yet important ways, changed the way I live. I genuinely want to share the best of those lessons with you and hope you can give this podcast a listen. Here are, in my opinion, some of the most valuable lessons that Jocko can teach us:</p>
			
			<p><b>1. Take Extreme Ownership</b></p>
			<p>We have no control over anything or anyone in life, except for our own selves. Therefore, we own our actions and each of us alone ultimately responsible for our own life, our own future, and everything that we do. It sounds fairly obvious, but is quite difficult in practice. It is so easy to make excuses about not being able to do something due to my circumstances. I often tell myself “I was too busy to…” or “I was too tired to…” or “I just didn’t feel like…” when I couldn’t get something done properly. In contrast, Jocko’s idea is that you must take ownership, take extreme ownership, of your life. You must not make excuses but take full responsibility of your actions, mistakes, future, and etc, because nobody else is required to that for you. Of course, we all face extreme situations in our lives sometimes where there are justified reasons for not being able to do our absolute best, and that’s completely fine. However, it is another thing to lie to ourselves and pretend that we seriously cannot do better, when it is actually just our laziness to do so.</p>

			<p><b>2. Exercise Discipline</b></p>
			<p>“Discipline equals freedom.” This is one of Jocko’s all time quotes, and when I first heard it I thought it was one of those quotes that are meant to sound deep but has no real meaning. However, knowing Jocko, I kept wondering what these 3 words were trying to say. In the end, I realized it meant literally and exactly what it says. The truth is that we don’t have full control over our body. From a scientific point of view, our body prefers doing things that grant immediate pleasures, such watching 4 hours of Youtube instead of doing work, sleeping in instead of going to school, or many other things not quite appropriate enough to be mentioned here, because our brain produces dopamine and serotonin to reward us for doing these things. However, because of these pleasures, we procrastinate, delay, get lazy, start slacking up, and lose focus of the important things to do. If I had the discipline to not watch Youtube but get some work done instead, I could be free of stress and have true spare time later. If I had the discipline to wake up on time, I could stay on task the whole day and do everything that I planned. By exercising discipline, we are no longer slaves of our bodies’ want for temporary, unimportant pleasures, we become free to achieve what we want. </p>
			
			<p><b>3. "Good"</b></p>
			<p>Also one of Jocko’s top, all time sayings. Super simple. The idea is that when you face a difficult problem or task, you need to be able to look at it, find something positive about it, say “good”, and tackle that problem. For example, in school, if we need to do a difficult or tedious project, good: we have an opportunity to really test ourselves; if there is something we don’t understand at all in class, good: there are more for us to learn. Again, there is a line after which saying “good” becomes pretending that everything is fine when they are really not. It is important to apply this idea appropriately, in situations where we have the healthy opportunity to improve. In Jocko’s words on his podcast: “That’s it… Don’t get startled, don’t get frustrated. No. You just look at the issue and you say, ‘good.’ Take that problem, and make it something good... If you can say the word ‘good’… you’ve still got some fight left in you. So get up… re-engage, and go out on the attack.”</p>
			
			<p>When listening to Jocko, it’s easy to feel the general gist that consistently shows in everything he says: don’t make excuses, don’t whine. Work hard, take responsibility, become a better person everyday and achieve great things. I hope I didn’t sound as though I do everything that he says, because I am no master of any of these things, but I am trying my best to apply the principles above in my life as often as possible. I now find myself consciously trying not to procrastinating; consciously trying to make no excuses when I make a mistake, instead trying to figure out how to do better next time; consciously saying “good” when the test I just wrote was really hard, because it means I need to study harder and really improve myself for the next test. I was almost not going to write this article because I told myself I was too busy and had other things to do, but I realized that just went against everything I would be talking about in the article. </p>
			<p>I wrote this article to share the amazing things that I have heard from Jocko and hopefully to inspire you to listen and learn as well. I am only 6 episodes into his podcast and barely scratching the surface. There are so much more to learn in his more than 300 hours of podcasts, as well as books about leadership and character. I want to really thank Nima for introducing me to this invaluable well of resources and for pushing with me to improve everyday. You can find Jocko’s podcasts on Youtube or Spotify for free. If you find that you don’t enjoy his content, find another podcast or even an audiobook that you can learn from, and listen to it whenever you can! Be productive and find every opportunity that you can to improve! Or as Jocko says: get after it!</p>
