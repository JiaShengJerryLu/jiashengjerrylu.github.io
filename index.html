        <p>... but you probably already know that :)  </p>
        <p>The resume you received from me is a carefully curated document specfically made for you. Meanwhile, this website serves as a comprehensive portfolio where you can find further details on any projects and experiences, as well as check out other works I've done.</p>
        <p>Please excuse the appearance of this site, I'm still making time to experiment with and get better at web development. If you found this website via my resume from a webdev posting, then that was probably an accident.</p>
